+sub_section( 'Translate Plugins Too' )
	p WordPress website is built from WordPress system itself, a theme, and plugin(s).

	p There is a very high chance that <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_in_Your_Language">WordPress itself is already translated into your language</a>. So, you don't have to translate it on your own. You have also learned how to translate the theme above. But what about plugins and their texts?

	p If you are lucky, your plugin contains your language translations already and you don't have to do anything. But if you need to translate a plugin, the best advice is to check the plugin's documentation for the best approach.

	p Alternatively you can also use <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/"><strong>Loco Translate</strong> plugin</a> (again) to translate your plugins directly in your WordPress admin area.
