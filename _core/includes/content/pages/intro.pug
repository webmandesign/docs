				p.
					<strong>Page Excerpt</strong> content depends on the page you are on.
					<br>
					If it is an actual WordPress Page or Post or any custom post type, you can set the <em>"Excerpt"</em> field text.
					<br>
					On taxonomy archive pages it displays the taxonomy term (such as post category or tag) description which you can set for any/all taxonomy terms in WordPress.
					<br>
					If you want to display some description text for the custom post type archive pages too, you need to <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-type-archive-descriptions/">use a plugin for that</a>.

					<strong>Intro image</strong> is taken from your website header images that can be set in <strong><em>Appearance &rarr; Customize &rarr; Header Media</em></strong>.
