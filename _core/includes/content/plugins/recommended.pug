+sub_section( 'Recommended Plugins', 'plugins-recommended' )
	p The theme uses the <a href="http://tgmpluginactivation.com/">TGM Plugin Activation</a> script that prompts you to install recommended plugins after you activate the theme.

	p The suggested recommended plugins are essential to provide the core functionality the theme relies on and/or to ease out the process of editing your website pages. <strong>You can still use the theme without these plugins, however, its functionality and your user experience would be limited.</strong>

	p Bellow you'll find a list of plugins that were successfully tested with the theme and works with it without any conflicts:
