+sub_section( 'Demo Content Import' )
	p The theme allows you to import a demo content, which matches <a href="https://themedemos.webmandesign.eu/#{config.slug}/">theme demo website</a>. Then you can simply change the imported demo content to your needs and build your website faster that way - no need to start from scratch.

	+tip( 'Delete leftovers' )
		p Please note that theme demo contains a lot of pages. You will certainly end up not using most of them. In that case it is strongly recommended to <strong>delete the leftover content you no longer need</strong> on your website. It improves your website performance and relevance.

	+important( 'Install on fresh WordPress' )
		p It is recommended to install demo content on <strong>empty, fresh WordPress site</strong>. Otherwise it might mess up your existing content! (If you are <a href="https://support.webmandesign.eu/testing-a-theme-on-your-computer/">testing a website on your own computer</a> and not your existing live website, you can always <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/reset/">reset your WordPress</a> to a fresh state.

	+danger( 'Images and media quality' )
		p Please understand that <strong>demo images, audio and video files are of <em>low</em> quality</strong>. This is due to copyright protection. You should replace them with your own, <a href="#credits">properly licensed images</a> that fit your website project the best anyway.
