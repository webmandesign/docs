h4 <strong>Updating via FTP</strong>

p This is a more advanced manual theme update procedure and you will need an FTP client (such as <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>) to connect to your server:

ol
	li (Re)download the theme ZIP file from the marketplace where you've purchased the theme at and unpack the ZIP file on your computer.

	li Now you will need an FTP client to connect to your server.

	li On your server navigate to <code>YOUR_WORDPRESS_INSTALLATION/wp-content/themes/</code> folder.

	li Delete the existing <code>#{config.slug}</code> folder (or create a backup just in case).

	li Copy the unpacked theme <code>#{config.slug}</code> folder from your computer (from step 1. above) to the <code>YOUR_WORDPRESS_INSTALLATION/wp-content/themes/</code> on your server.

	li Log into your WordPress admin area and check the version of the theme in <strong><em>Appearance &raquo; Themes</em></strong>. Your theme should be updated now.
