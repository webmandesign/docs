				p Set up global base font size and tweak harmonious typography ratios. The theme will then automatically calculate font sizes for headings and other elements to assure the best readability experience.

				p Text sizes are also responsively fluid, adapting to your visitor's screen size.

				p You can also set up custom font families, which can be simply and consistently reused in block editor without breaking your website design and typography by mixing too many of different fonts.

				p And, you are also free to use any font family from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>. <strong>#{config.name}</strong> theme even makes sure these font families are served directly from your website and not from Google's servers.
