	p For creating and <strong>managing widget areas (sidebars)</strong> use a plugin such as Content Aware Sidebars (or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/sidebars/">any similar plugin should do the trick</a>).

	p This type of plugin is also great to alter you website layout with ease. Here are couple of example usecases:

	+alert( 'Classic Widgets interface', 'orange', 'h4', '<strong>Tip:</strong>' )
		p When using a sidebar management plugin, it is recommended to restore classic WordPress widgets interface with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-widgets/"><strong>Classic Widgets</strong> plugin</a>.

	h4 Remove sidebar on specific pages

	p Simply create a new custom sidebar, let's call it <em>"Empty"</em>, and set it to replace the actual theme's <a href="#sidebars"><em>"Sidebar"</em></a> on specific pages.

	p Then just leave this new custom sidebar empty, with no widgets in it. It causes adaptation of the theme layout when no sidebar is detected on those specific pages. This way you've effectively removed sidebar.

	+alert( 'Initiate an empty sidebar', 'red', 'h5', '<strong>Important:</strong>' )
		p After creating a new sidebar in WordPress, you might need to initiate it first. To do this simply navigate to #[+mark( 'nav', 'Appearance', 'Widgets' )], add a widget to your "Empty" sidebar, and then delete the widget from the sidebar. Now the sidebar should be properly registered in your WordPress.

	+tip( 'Reverse approach', 'h5' )
		p If you, on the other hand, want to display the sidebar on some pages only, you can use reverse logic:

		p Leave the theme's "Sidebar" empty and create a "Sidebar with widgets" using the plugin. Then set it to display on the specific pages and add some widgets into it.

	h4 Display a different footer on specific page

	p Create a new custom sidebar, let's call it <em>"About page intro widgets"</em>, and set it to replace the actual theme's <a href="#sidebars"><em>"Footer Widgets"</em> widget area</a> on the specific page (on the "About" page in our case).

	p Then go ahead and add some widgets into the <em>"About page intro widgets"</em> sidebar in #[+mark( 'nav', 'Appearance', 'Widgets' )]. This new custom sidebar will be displayed in the footer on your "About" page.

	+tip( 'Controlling a single widget', 'h5' )
		p If you would like to control a single widget display instead of the whole sidebar, you can use <a href="https://jetpack.com/support/widget-visibility/"><strong>Jetpack</strong> plugin's "Widget Visibility" feature</a> (or try <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/widget-options/"><strong>Widget Options</strong> plugin</a>).
